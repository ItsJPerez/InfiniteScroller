# InfiniteScroller
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to implement infinite scroll functionality, similar to how social media works, making it seem you are seamlessly scrolling forever.


Images are fetched from the Unsplash API.


Interactivity is also added, as when hovering over an image it shows a brief description & clicking on an image we can view it on the Unsplash website for image details.
